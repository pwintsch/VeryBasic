Lots done so lets recap, the next step for my terminal basic:
    ( ) Objective run Ahl's Basic games unchanged
    (X) Load Bagels.bas and run unchanged
    ( ) Bug fixing
        (X) Track down why (5 goto goto 10) crashes 
        (X) Correct STR$ StrFnct output and Syntax
    (X) ON xxx GOTO yyy command
    (X) ON xxx GOSUB yyy command
    (X) Develop ELSE functionality
    (X) Allow declaration of multiple arrays with single DIM statement change syntax to tUserDefinedList and Adapt DIMcmd
    (X) Allow Rnd(number) as Syntax
    ( ) System variable and constants (PI Timer)
    ( ) Clean up the SAVE command particularly with Quotes in strings
    ( ) See if parser can take a literal option for load, save and changedir so no quotes are required
    ( ) Find some/lots of test basic programs
    ( ) Think of adding BBC BASIC or SINCLAIR SUPERBASIC structured basic commands 
        (X) Allow multiple syntaxes for Functions (eg RND)
        ( ) LABELS
        (X) REPEAT .... UNTIL xxxxx
        (X) WHILE xxx ... WEND
        ( ) User defined PROCEDURES
        ( ) User define FUNCTIONS





To get VeryBasic to the level above TinyBasic I need to add :
    (X) Function parsing mechanism
    (X) Function integration into Expression evaluation
    (X) Function parsing check of right number of parametres (in CommandNode.InitialiseWithArguments)
    (X) Check return type of Expressions
    (X) Function parsing check of right return type of parametre expression (in Command::Lexerize)
    (X) Check Command arguments are of right type if expression
    (X) FOR NEXT STEP TO DOWNTO
    (X) READ DATA RESTORE
    (X) Build in Break mechanism into Program loop
    (X) Build Stop in Input
    (X) Write Continue program
    (X) EDIT command
    (X) Some of the improvements left below (in particular Type checking of Expressions)
    (X) Check why DIM command returns a 0 Error

    And then we will look at Maths functions

And then to get it to Nanobasic level
    (X) RANDOMIZE Command
    (X) CONTINUE Command
    (X) DEF FN Command 
        (X) Parse for DEF
        (X) Parse for FN
        (X) DefCmd push function information on DefFN Stack
        (X) Add control to parser to ensure SubParam of FunctionName only variables
        (X) Adjust variable stack to create context and local stack
        (X) DefCmd pushes local variable values on stack with context and remove after avaluate
        (X) adjust evaluation
    (X) NODELIST Command (take line number as parametre)
    (X) RND function
    (X) MAX function
    (-) TEST function
    (X) LEFT function
        (X) Finalise Truncate of string
    (X) INKEY function
    (X) SQRT function
    (-) MEM function


Previously ...

To get current interpreter to Tiny Basic level I need to:
    (X) Write the IF xxx THEN command control flow and sort out return codes for commands
    (X) Create the MyProcessor RUN command and functionality which require program pointers etc..
    (X) add the GOTO command
    (X) add the STOP and END commands
    (X) add the GOSUB and RETURN command
    (X) add the SAVE command
        (-) Decide what to do when double quotes in string
    (X) add the LOAD command
    (X) add Arrays
        (X) In Arrays.Store check dimensions size and range
    (X) Create PWD command
    (X) Create ChangeDirectory command
        (-) Decide if you can chgdir without quotes
    (X) test Expression when creating for return type


    ( ) Bug fixing
        (X) When saving OR operator no spaces either side
    ( ) Clean up line editing
        (X) Write a slimmed down version of GetLine so there are less trailing spaces
        (X) Clean up if edit on last line of screen
    ( ) Move variables to std::any
    (X) Add Basic functions
        (X) LEN function
