To get VeryBasic to the level above TinyBasic I need to add :
    ( ) FOR NEXT STEP TO DOWNTO
    ( ) READ DATA RESTORE
    ( ) Some of the improvements left below (in particular Type checking of Expressions)
    And then we will look at Maths functions



To get current interpreter to Tiny Basic level I need to:
    (X) Write the IF xxx THEN command control flow and sort out return codes for commands
    (X) Create the MyProcessor RUN command and functionality which require program pointers etc..
    (X) add the GOTO command
    (X) add the STOP and END commands
    (X) add the GOSUB and RETURN command
    (X) add the SAVE command
        ( ) Decide what to do when double quotes in string
    (X) add the LOAD command
    (X) add Arrays
        (X) In Arrays.Store check dimensions size and range
    (X) Create PWD command
    (X) Create ChangeDirectory command
        ( ) Decide if you can chgdir without quotes
    ( ) test Expression when creating for return type
