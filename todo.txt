To get VeryBasic to the level above TinyBasic I need to add :
    (X) Function parsing mechanism
    (X) Function integration into Expression evaluation
    (X) Function parsing check of right number of parametres (in CommandNode.InitialiseWithArguments)
    (X) Check return type of Expressions
    (X) Function parsing check of right return type of parametre expression (in Command::Lexerize)
    (X) Check Command arguments are of right type if expression
    (X) FOR NEXT STEP TO DOWNTO
    (X) READ DATA RESTORE
    (X) Build in Break mechanism into Program loop
    (X) Build Stop in Input
    (X) Write Continue program
    (X) EDIT command
        ( ) Write a slimmed down version of GetLine so there are less trailing spaces
        ( ) Clean up if edit on last line of screen
    ( ) Some of the improvements left below (in particular Type checking of Expressions)
    ( ) Check why DIM command returns a 0 Error

    And then we will look at Maths functions

And then to get it to Nanobasic level
    (X) RANDOMIZE Command
    (X) CONTINUE Command
    ( ) DEF FN Command 
    (X) NODELIST Command (take line number as parametre)
    (X) RND function
    (X) MAX function
    ( ) TEST function
    (X) LEFT function
        (X) Finalise Truncate of string
    (X) INKEY function
    (X) SQRT function
    ( ) MEM function


Previously ...

To get current interpreter to Tiny Basic level I need to:
    (X) Write the IF xxx THEN command control flow and sort out return codes for commands
    (X) Create the MyProcessor RUN command and functionality which require program pointers etc..
    (X) add the GOTO command
    (X) add the STOP and END commands
    (X) add the GOSUB and RETURN command
    (X) add the SAVE command
        ( ) Decide what to do when double quotes in string
    (X) add the LOAD command
    (X) add Arrays
        (X) In Arrays.Store check dimensions size and range
    (X) Create PWD command
    (X) Create ChangeDirectory command
        ( ) Decide if you can chgdir without quotes
    (X) test Expression when creating for return type
